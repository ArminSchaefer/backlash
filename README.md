# backlash
In this project, I examine the theory of populism advanced by Pippa Norris and Ronald Inglehart in their recent book [*Cultural Backlash*](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cultural-backlash/3C7CB32722C7BB8B19A0FC005CAFD02B). The authors offer a distinct explanation of the rise of populism in advanced democracy and build on Inglehartâ€™s work on long-term value change. Packed with empirical analyses and insights, the book nonetheless fails to offer a convincing account of populism. Three problems are particularly noteworthy. First, in contrast to what the authors argue, there is no cultural conflict between younger and older cohorts who differ only in their degree of liberalism and not in principle. Second, putting left-wing and right-wing populist parties into one category blurs important distinctions and is at odds with the theory. Third, the results do not fit to theory, as younger cohorts are more likely to vote for authoritarian-populist parties. After reanalyzing the main arguments of Cultural Backlash, it is suggested to focus instead on a political backlash that results from alienation caused by unequal responsiveness.

To reproduce my analyses, you will have to register with the [European Social Survey](http://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/user/new) to access the data. I cannot provide the full dataset here. In addition, I analyse CHES data, which is freely available and also data from the British Election Study, which is avaiable after [registration](https://www.britishelectionstudy.com/wp-login.php?action=register).
